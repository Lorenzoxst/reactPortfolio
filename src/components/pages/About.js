                        <p>My name is Lorenzo Street-Simmons. I am a pseudo in training junior full-stack developer with some real world experience already. Im currently remote learning out of Birmingham, AL but plan to soon be remote working out of Atlanta, Ga.
                            Im pursing this career because I love to create, and I think that this medium is the best one for me. Someone out there is going to want to see the crazy wonderful stuff in my head.</p>
